1. the whole thing is in czech. good luck.
2. Made entirely in Python, this is a simulation of walking through a finite projective plane inspired by text-based adventure games.

As for the other text files, which serve as specialised readmes:

3. Uživatelská dokumentace = user documentation, a manual - HOW TO USE
4. Programátorská dokumentace = programmer/future me documentation - HOW IT WORKS

this is a mess so far, maybe I'll get to it sometime and make it more comprehensible. Or even more English.
sorry and good luck
